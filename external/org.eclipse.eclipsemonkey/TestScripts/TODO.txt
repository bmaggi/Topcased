Programming Tasks
-----------------

DOM: metadata causes automatic load
website


monkey icon drop-down menu
add more samples from users
paste new script from url


handle resource changes as monkey triggers
hard-code strings; etc
partition projects to enable use in RCP
handle script renames by just renaming instead remove and add

dom that participates in the code completion by looking at both the static
 type structure and the existing object structure

Script Use Cases
----------------
1. scan for swear words [VERSION ONE WORKING] 
A. build a manifest.txt for ourselves from the directory contents
2. expand all in the plug-in editor
3. watch for nearby changes
4. expanded wiki syntax into javadoc
5. feed something into the project dashboard
6. replace all enum with something else -- Bill
7. run a sequence of ant builds in a particular order; build.xmls in different projects
8. monkey script to check id conventions
9. systematically apply patches, whatever that means
10. look for things in the code and announce them via IM; visibility to a larger group; something that is somehow relevant
11. write a script to maintain a dynamic menu (hard -- threading)
12. call home with Kudos distribution e.g.
13. turn the JUnit test bar gray when saving a script file that was run in the tests
	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=119533
14. select multiple files in the navigator/synchronization window and export them as a jar
15. loop over test cases looking for a heisenbug -- due to Ed Warnicke

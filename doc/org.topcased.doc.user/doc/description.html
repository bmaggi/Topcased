									Copy/Cut is available when only one element is selected in the diagram and that this element is associated with a domain element.

									After the Paste action is performed, new domain elements are created and the diagram is automatically populated using default Importer mechanism (available when using DND between the outline and the diagram).
									It means that graphical properties (font, colors, size, ...) are not kept between the two copies.

								<strong>&lt;&lt; New in 2.1.0 &gt;&gt;</strong>
								<p>
								  There is now support to write user scripts to automate some tasks in Topcased (only if
                                  you have installed the Experimental features). The scripts are written in the JavaScript
                                  language and placed directly in the workspace: there is no need to deploy a new plugin
                                  or even to restart Eclipse.
                                </p>

								<p>
                                  The scripts have access to the current editor's selection, and can navigate in models,
                                  create/modify existing elements and save the results. They can also interact with the
                                  user to ask him for parameters and display results.
                                </p>

								<p>
                                  Sample scripts are available for SAM, SysML and UML. To get them, do "File > New >
                                  Other", and in the new "Topcased > Topcased Scripting" category, select one of the
                                  examples projects (for example "Example UML Scripts"). This creates a new Topcased
                                  project in the workspace, with example scripts pre-installed. The scripts can be invoked
                                  from Eclipse's top-level "Scripts" menu, in the "Topcased" sub-menu.
                                </p>

								<strong>&lt;&lt; New in 0.11.0 &gt;&gt;</strong>
								<p>	These actions are mainly used to split/merge a model into several models. This functionality is mainly used to share a same model between different users. You can "<strong>Control</strong>" (or split) a model from the Outline View. Select the element you want to extract in a new file, "Right Click &gt; Control" :
									<img src="images/controlAction.jpg" alt="controlAction" />
									Then, you have to choose a file where the subModel should be stored (Do not forget to indicate the corresponding file extension) :
									<img src="images/selectControlledFileDialog.jpg" alt="selectControlledFileDialog&quot;" />
									At this point, when you save the model, the new controlled file should appear in the Package Explorer view. An associated diagrams file is also created : it will contains all the diagrams contained in the hierarchy of the controlled element, or none. You can then edit that diagrams, all changes are made in that file (the original file only keep a reference to that controlled file).
								</p>
								<p>	Later, you can choose to "<strong>Uncontrol</strong>" (or merge) these two models. In the original model file, select the controlled element (it should be decorated with a special icon in the Outline View), and then "Right Click &gt; Uncontrol" :

									A dialog opens to ask if you want to delete the controlled files or keep them. If you decide to keep them, they will not have been modified by the Uncontrol action. Otherwise they are removed from the disk. At the end of the action, the contents of the controlled files (model and diagrams) should be merged into that model.

							<td class="noteworthydescription" valign="top">
							  <strong>&lt;&lt; New in 2.0.0 &gt;&gt;</strong>
							  <p>These new actions extend the Control/Uncontrol actions to enable collaboration: controlling a
							  sub-model allows to physically split it across multiple files, but the controlled model still
							  depends on its parent. The new &quot;<b>Export</b>&quot; action creates an autonomous version of the
							  sub-model, which can be sent to another user (e.g. a sub-contractor). He can then view and edit it
							  without access to the whole original model. The &quot;Import&quot; action can later be used to
							  integrate changes made by the user back into the original model.</p>
							  
							  <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: When exporting part of an UML model, if elements of the sub-model to export
                              have stereotypes applied to them, the corresponding Profiles <strong>must</strong> be applied directly on
                              the package being exported. It is not enough for the profile to be applied on a parent
                              element which will not be part of the exported model. If the profile is initially only
                              applied to such a parent element, you must manually apply it also in the package to
                              export before executing the export operation.</p>
							  
							  <p>Once a model has been controlled, a new action &quot;<b>Export</b>&quot; is available: from the
							  Outline View, select the controlled element you want to export and &quot;Right Click &gt;
							  Export&quot;:</p>
							  <img src="images/exportModelAction.jpg" alt="Export Action" />
							  <p>A wizard opens. The first page allows you to select the name of the sub-model (without a file
							  extension), and the target directory where it will be saved:</p>
							  <img src="images/exportWizardPage1.jpg" alt="First page of the export wizard: target name and location selection" />
							  <p>In order to make the exported sub-model autonomous (i.e. usable without the complete original
							  model), the export action includes copies of all its dependencies into a new, companion model named
							  the <b>cache</b>. The second page of the export wizard shows you a preview of what will be included
							  in this cache, and gives you some control over it:</p>
							  <img src="images/exportWizardPage2.jpg" alt="Second page of the export wizard: cache preview" />
							  <p>There are three categories of elements in the cache:</p>
							  <ul>
							    <li><b>Strict dependencies</b> include the minimum elements which are required for the exported
							    model to load without errors. Its content is automatically computed and can not be changed. You
							    may discover here that your model has unwanted dependencies you had not realized. You can cancel
							    the export action to fix this.</li>
							    <li><b>Semantic dependencies</b> include elements which are not required to load the exported
							    model but without which its meaning may be altered. The content of this category will depend on
							    the meta-model (e.g. UML, SAM, SysML, etc.). For example, for UML models it will include profile
							    and stereotype applications. The content of this category is automatically computed and can not be
							    changed.</li>
							    <li>Finally, the <b>user elements</b> category, which is initialy empty, allows you to manually
							    add elements from the parent model into the cache. This is useful if you know the user of the
							    exported model will need access to elements it does not yet depend on to do his work (for example
							    a library he will have to use). You can modify the contents of this category using the <b>Add</b>
							    and <b>Remove</b> buttons on the right.</li>
							  </ul>
							  <p>Once you are satisfied with the contents of the cache, you can click <b>Finish</b> to actually
							  perform the export operation, and then save the model.</p>
							  <p>The export process will not modify the original models (including the controlled sub-model), but
							  will create 5 new files:</p>
							  <img src="images/exportNewFiles.jpg" alt="The files created by the export process." />
							  <p>In the example above, we exported the <b>Feature</b> package (which was initially controlled)
							  from the <b>ParentModel</b> UML model. The new files created are:</p>
							  <ul>
							    <li><b>Feature.part.uml</b> and <b>Feature.part.umldi</b>: the exported versions of the
							    <b>Feature</b> sub-model and its diagrams.</li>
							    <li><b>Feature.cache.uml</b> and <b>Feature.cache.umldi</b>: copies of the elements and diagrams
							    required by the exported model.</li>
							    <li><b>Feature.properties</b>: this new file stores meta-information about the exported status of
							    the <b>Feature.uml</b> model. It should be kept with the original model and put in configuration
							    with it.</li>
							  </ul>
							  <p>The <b>*.part.*</b> and <b>*.cache.*</b> files are self-contained: they reference each other, but
							  are not connected to the original models in any way. They can be sent together to another user, who
							  will be able to open the model and modify it. They can be safely removed from the parent model's
							  workspace. Two important things to note:</p>
							  <ul>
							    <li><b>The cache should be considered read-only and never modified by the user.</b></li>
							    <li><b>After it has been exported, the controlled sub-model should also be considered read-only
							    until is is re-imported.</b></li>
							  </ul>
							  <p>Once the exported version of a sub-model has been modified, it is possible to re-integrate these
							  changes into the main model using the &quot;<b>Import</b>&quot; action. It is available on
							  controlled sub-models which are marked as exported (through their associated .properties file). The
							  action opens a wizard:</p>
							  <img src="images/importWizardPage1.jpg" alt="First page of the import wizard: select the model to import" />
							  <p>The first wizard page, shown above, allows you to select the sub-model to import (the
							  <b>Feature.part.uml</b> file in our example). The next two pages of the wizard allow to preview and
							  configure the import process: because the main model and the exported model may have changed since
							  the export, cross references between them may need to be tweaked so they can be re-integrated
							  together. The first of these pages treats references from the main model to the controlled model,
							  which must be updated to point to the new sub-model being imported. The second page treats
							  references from the model being imported to its cache, which must be updated to point back to the
							  new version of the parent model.</p>
							  <img src="images/importWizardPage2.jpg" alt="Second page of the import wizard: cross-model references configuration" />
							  <p>Both pages are organized in the same way:</p>
							  <ul>
							    <li>The top part shows the current external element being referenced, and the new version it will
							    be updated to point to. When the element in question has not been deleted since the export, the
							    import action should be able to retreive it and no action is necessary. If the replacement can not
							    be found automatically, the element will be shown in red, and a default replacement automatically
							    chosen. You can choose another replacement by clicking in the <b>Replacement</b> column and
							    selecting one of the proposed candidates.</li>
							    <li>The bottom part of the wizard shows how the element currently selected in the top part is used
							    in the model, to assist you in selecting the right candidate. In the example above, we can see
							    that the <b>Feature</b> package (selected in the top part) is used by the <b>ParentModel</b>
							    package as one of its owned elements.</li>
							  </ul>
							  <p>Once you are satisfied with the import configuration, you can click <b>Finish</b> to complete the
							  process. The controlled model will be replaced by the version from the <b>*.part.*</b> files, and
							  the connections between the main model and this new sub-model updated according to the configuration
							  specified in the wizard.</p>

									It is possible to manage domain model and its diagram into a single archive model. A set of actions are available to manage archive models : depending on the current selection, actions are visible or not.

										<img class="icon" src="images/createRAS.png"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Create <i>xxx</i> Archive (uncompressed)</strong> : create an uncompressed archive (TAR) from a set of files
										<ul>
											<li>You should select at least two files, the domain model and its associated diagrams file (must have same name).</li>
											<li>The type of archive you can create depends on extension of the selected files : currently archive models are only implemented for SAM, SysML and UML models.</li>
											<li>Creating an archive model will remove original resources, create an archive file and create necessary linked resources. A resource is linked when its location is different than the default location calculated by the platform : it is also decorated with a particular icon <img class="icon" src="images/link_ovr.gif"/>.</li>
											<li>Archive file extension is computed from the domain model one, suffixed with '<strong>z</strong>' for a compressed archive or '<strong>r</strong>' for an uncompressed one.</li>
										</ul>

										<img class="icon" src="images/extractRAS.png"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Restore From <i>xxx</i> Archive</strong> : extract the files contained within an archive (JAR) and remove this archive model<br/>
										<img class="icon" src="images/extractRAS.png"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Restore From <i>xxx</i> Archive (uncompressed)</strong> : extract the files contained within an uncompressed archive (TAR) and remove this archive model
										<ul>
											<li>You can restore files contained within a given archive model.</li>
											<li>Restore consists of removing linked resources (pointing to the files contained by the archive model), recreating those files and removing the archive file.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p><img class="icon" src="images/addToRAS.png"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Add To Archive ...</strong>
										<ul>
											<li>You should select one or more Resource in the workspace. All these Resources should be contained within the same container.</li>
											<li>A dialog lets you choose among the possible archive models : you can only add them to an archive present in the same container corresponding to the initial selection.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p><img class="icon" src="images/extractFromRAS.png"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Extract From Archive</strong>
										<ul>
											<li>You should select one or more <strong>linked</strong> resources in the workspace. All these resources should be contained within the same archive model.</li>

								<strong>&lt;&lt; Added in 2.7.0 and 3.1.0 &gt;&gt;</strong>
								<p>
									Due to some specificities on the underlying Browser which is used to render your documentation in the rich text editor, there are different way to modify the
									structure of a table that has been presviously created. It mainly depends on your operating system and the Browser you are using by default :
								</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>On Linux/Solaris platform + Mozilla browser</strong>
										<p>
											On GTK and Motif platforms, an instance of a "Mozilla browser" is created to render styled text. As Mozilla browsers have a build-in XULRunner,
											tables have special controls to insert/remove a row/column. These controls appear when a cell gain focus : you can then either create a new
											row/column just before or after the one containing the selected cell, or remove the row/column related to the selected cell.
											<img src="images/richtext/modifyTableOnLinux.png" alt="modifyTableOnLinux"/>
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>On Windows platform + IE browser</strong>
										<p>
											On WIN32 platforms, an instance of an "Internet Explorer browser" is created to render styled text. Tables are simpler and do not have any built in
											handles to perform insert/remove a row/column. However, it is possible to change the table structure through actions from the toolbar.
											<ol>
												<li style="color:green">First, select the table you want to modify : passing near a border of the table will change your mouse cursor</li>
												<li style="color:blue">Then, click to select the table, selection handles should appear</li>
												<li style="color:red">Finally, select the action to perform from the toolbar depending on what you want to perform : <img class="icon" src="images/richtext/insertTableColIcon.png" /> <img class="icon" src="images/richtext/deleteTableColIcon.png" /> <img class="icon" src="images/richtext/insertTableRowIcon.png" /> <img class="icon" src="images/richtext/deleteTableRowIcon.png" /></li>
											</ol> 
											<img src="images/richtext/modifyTableOnWindows.png" alt="modifyTableOnWindows"/>
											In all case, you will have to specify the index where the row/column will be inserted/removed. You can do that in the dialog window :
											you must specify a positive integer value, but if the position index does not match with the size of the table, the default row/column
											to be inserted/removed is the last one.

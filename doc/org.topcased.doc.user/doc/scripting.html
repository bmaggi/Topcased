    <h1>Topcased Scripting Support</h1>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>This document describes the new scripting support added to Topcased 2.1.
    This feature allows users to write scripts to automate some tasks in
    Topcased. The scripts are written in the JavaScript language and placed
    directly in the workspace: there is no need to deploy a new plugin or even
    to restart Eclipse, which makes them much more convenient than plugins for
    simple tasks.</p>

    <p>The scripts have access to the current Topcased editor's selection, and
    can navigate in models, create/modify existing elements and save the
    results. They can also interact with the user to ask him/her for parameters
    and to display results.</p>

    <p>Note that scripts are designed to automate simple tasks. They are not a
    replacement for plug-ins and do not have access to all the features of
    Topcased or the Eclipse platform. While for simple tasks scripts are simpler
    than plug-ins (especially easier to deploy), as complexity grows, it is
    better to write the functionality in Java as part of Topcased or an
    additional plug-in.</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

    <p>Topcased Scripting support is part of the Topcased Experimental feature.
    It depends on the Eclipse Monkey scripting engine, from Eclipse's Dash
    project but available on Topcased's update site. Normally all the
    dependencies are installed as part of the Topcased Experimental feature.</p>
    
    <p>To check whether you have everything properly installed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>In the toplevel menu-bar of Eclipse (or Topcased RCP), you should
      have a "Scripts" menu.</p>

      <img src="images/scripting/Scripting-Main-Menu.png" alt="The main 'Scripts' menu"/>

      <p>If it is not there, you need to install Eclipse Monkey manually; it is
      available in the Topcased project update site at <a
      href="http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/">http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/</a>,
      in the "Enabling Features" category.</p></li>

      <li><p>Open the general creation wizard ("File > New > Other"). In the
      Topcased category, you should have a new (in Topcased 2.1) sub-category
      named "Topcased Scripting" with several choices, like "Example UML Scripts
      Project".</p>

      <img src="images/scripting/Scripting-Wizards.png" alt="Example Script Projects Wizards"/>

      <p>If this is not the case, make sure you have installed the Topcased
      Experimental feature, which contains the scripting support.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Although not strictly required, it is highly recommended to install the
    <em>JavaScript Developer Tools</em> if you want to write, edit or even
    simply look at existing scripts. This feature is available fromt the main
    Ganymede update site in the category "Web and Java EE Development".</p>

    <h2 id="running">Running Scripts</h2>

    <p>Topcased Scripts are simple text files written in the JavaScript
    language, with some additional constraints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The file name must end with the <code>.js</code> extension. For
      example <code>umlAddClass.js</code>.</li>
      <li>To be detected by the scripting infrastructure, the scripts should
      always be placed in a directory named <code>scripts</code> directly inside
      of a project in your workspace. The project does not have to be a Topcased
      project, but keep in mind that non-Topcased projects are not visible by
      default from the Topcased Navigator.</li>
      <li>There are some additional constraints on the contents of the file
      itself, which are described in <a href="#writing">the next section</a>.
      You do not have to worry about them to simply <em>use</em> scripts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The scripting infrastructure should automatically and dynamically detect
    all the properly placed scripts in you workspace (from any open project),
    and give access to them from the top-level "Scripts" menu. The scripts are
    organized there in sub-menus (and sub-sub-menus, etc.) according to
    annotations defined inside the scripts themselves. Because the basic
    scripting infrastructure is not specific to Topcased and can be used for
    other tasks, it is good practice to put all the Topcased scripts in a
    <em>Topcased</em> sub-menu. The example scripts provided by default are
    further organized according to the language/meta-model they target, so you
    have sub-menus like <em>Topcased > SAM</em> and <em>Topcased > UML</em>:</p>

    <img src="images/scripting/Scripting-Menus.png" alt="Default scripting menu organization"/>

    <p>The documentation for each script (what it does, what it expects as
    input, etc.) is generally included directly in the script file, as
    comments.</p>

    <p>To invoke a script, simply select it from the "Scripts" menu. Most of the
    Topcased scripts expect that a model is currently open in Topcased with some
    element selected as input. Each script can have different expectations, so
    you should read its comments to know what they are.</p>

    <p>Scripts may interact with you by opening various dialogs to ask for
    additional informations and have several options to present their
    results:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some will have no directly visible result except in the way they
      modified the model.</li>
      <li>They can present simple results in dialog boxes.</li>
      <li>The can print text results in the new "Topcased Scripts" console. Make
      sure the Console view is open (Window > Show view... > Console), and the
      Topcased Scripts console should automatically open and become visible when
      a scripts appends its results to it.</li>
      <li>Finally, for more complex results, scripts can write their results in
      text files inside the workspace. Well-behaved scripts should allow you to
      select the location of the file if possible, and tell you where to find
      the results after they successfuly executed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="examples">Example Scripts Projects</h3>

    <p>Topcased 2.1 provides wizards to automatically create projects in your
    workspace with example script already written and ready to use. To use this
    feature, open the project creation wizard, and in the "Topcased > Topcased
    Scripting" category, select one of the example projects. There is one for
    each of SAM, SysML and UML, with example scripts for the corresponding
    language/meta-model.</p>

    <p>The projects created by these wizards are called "Example <i>XXX</i>
    Scripts". Inside, you will find a scripts folder with example scripts.</p>

    <p>The scripting infrastructure should have automatically detected the
    presence of the new scripts, and added them to the main "Scripts" menu, in
    the "Topcased > XXX" sub-menu. You can invoke these simply by selecting them
    in the menu, but most of them require a model of the right kind to be open
    with an input element selected. Open the scripts files and read their
    documentation on how to use each of them.</p>

    <p>These scripts are simply provided as examples, to illustrate what is
    possible with the currently packaged services and provide a starting point
    for you to write your own.</p>

    <h2 id="writing">Writing your own scripts</h2>

    <p>The scripts are written in the JavaScript programming language.
    JavaScript is a standard language and will not be presented in this
    document. If you do not know it, there are many freely available guides
    available on the web. However, keep in mind that most of this documentation
    is targetted to using JavaScript in the context of a web browser to
    manipulate web pages. In the context of Topcased, the core language is the
    same but the objects and services the scripts have access to are very
    different: while a JavaScript program inside a browser manipulates objects
    which represent the current web page, Topcased scripts manipulate objects
    (called DOMs) which represent model elements and provide services for user
    interaction.</p>

    <p>The set of services available to Topcased scripts can be extended through
    Eclipse plugins (see <a href="#extending">the last section of this
    document</a>). Those which are provided by default in Topcased 2.1 are
    document later in this section.</p>

    <h3>Overall Structure of Script Files</h3>

    <p>As mentioned earlier, Topcased Scripts have some constraints on their
    name, location, and contents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The file name must end with the <code>.js</code> extension. For
      example <code>umlAddClass.js</code>.</li>
      <li>To be detected by the scripting infrastructure, the scripts should
      always be placed in a directory named <code>scripts</code> directly inside
      of a project in your workspace. The project does not have to be a Topcased
      project, but keep in mind that non-Topcased projects are not visible by
      default from the Topcased Navigator.</li>
      <li><p>Scripts should begin with a specially formatted comment header,
      which contains some meta-data to indicate the scripting infrastructure how
      to use it:</p>
      <pre>
/*
 * Menu: Topcased > UML > Add class
 * License: EPL 1.0
 * DOM: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update/org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey.lang.javascript
 * DOM: http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting
 * DOM: http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting.uml
 */
      </pre>
      <p>Each line in this header defines one property of the script:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><code>Menu</code> gives the name of the script (here "Add class")
	and its location inside the top-level "Scripts" menu. Sub-menus are
	indicated by <code>&gt;</code>. In the example above, the script will be
	named "Add class" and appear in the "UML" sub-sub-menu of the "Topcased"
	sub-menu.</li>
	<li><code>License</code> is optional and indicate the license of the
	script.</li>
	<li><p><code>DOM</code> indicates that the script will make use of the
	service or services identified by the given URI. A script can have
	several such lines to use several DOMs. Each such line gives the script
	access to one or several objects through which it can call services.</p>
	<p>In the example above, the DOMs used are:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><code>http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update/org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey.lang.javascript</code>:
	  this the core DOM which provides the basic infrastructure support. It should be present in all scripts.</li>
	  <li><code>http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting</code>:
	  this DOM provides functions to allow Topcased Scripts to interact with
	  the user, asking for additional information and presenting their
	  results. It should be present in all Topcased scripts except in very
	  special circumstances.</li>
	  <li><code>http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting.uml</code>:
	  this DOM provides services specific to UML models. Corresponding DOMs
	  are provided for SAM and SysML, with a similar identifier except for
	  the last part (resp. <code>sam</code> and <code>sysml</code> instead
	  of <code>uml</code>). Note that because SysML is an extension of UML,
	  many SysML scripts will want to use both the SysML and the UML DOMs.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>Finally, the code of the script itself should be defined in a
      top-level JavaScript funtion named <code>main()</code> and taking no
      argument:</p>
      <pre>function main() { /* The script's code. */ }</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To summarize, here is the skeleton of an empty script:</p>

    <pre>
/*
 * Menu: MyMenu > The script name
 * License: EPL 1.0
 * DOM: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update/org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey.lang.javascript
 * DOM: http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting
 * DOM: http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting.uml
 */

/**
 * Documentation for the script.
 */
function main() {
  /* The main code of the script, which will be executed when it is invoked from the menu. */
}

function aux(arg) {
  /* Scripts can define additional JavaScript functions aside from the main one,
   * and call them from there.
   */
}
    </pre>

    <p>In each of the example projects available through the wizards (described
    in the previous section), a script called "New script" is provided. It will
    ask you for a location and a name and automatically create a skeleton script
    of the correct form, configured for the corresponding language (e.g. the
    "Topcased > UML > New script" script will automatically include the UML
    DOM). This way you don't have to remember the details of this file sctucture
    and simply call the script when you want to write a new one.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Walkthrough of a Simple Example</h3>

    <p>We will now walk through a complete example script line-by-line, using
    the example script to add a new UML class to a model.</p>

    <pre>
/*
 * Menu: Topcased > UML > Add class
 * License: EPL 1.0
 * DOM: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update/org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey.lang.javascript
 * DOM: http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting
 * DOM: http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting.uml
 */
    </pre>

    <p>The script starts with a header as described above. It specifies the
    location of the script inside the "Scripts" menu, and indicates that it will
    make use of the UML-specific services in addition to the generic
    infrastructure.</p>

    <pre>
/**
 * This script create a new UML class in the current package. A package must be
 * selected in the current UML editor.
 */
    </pre>

    <p>This is simply a block comment used to document the purpose of the script
    and its expectations to run successfuly.</p>

    <pre>
function main() {
	var name;
	var parentPackage = uml.getSelection("Package");
	if (parentPackage == null) {
		output.error("A Package must be selected in the current UML editor to run this script.");
		return;
	}
    </pre>

    <p>This is the beginning of the script's code itself, inside a JavaScript
    function called <code>main()</code>. It first declares the variables it will
    use with <code>var</code>: it is good practice in JavaScript to declare all
    the variables you will use in a function right at the beginning. The second
    variable, <code>parentPackage</code>, is initialized from the currently
    selected element in the UML editor using the <code>uml.getSelection()</code>
    service. In this case we pass a type name to the service, so it will only
    return a selection of the expected type. If there is no currently selected
    element or it is not a Package, the service returns <code>null</code>, and
    the script reacts by showing an error message (using the
    <code>output.error()</code> service) and exiting. Otherwise, it continues
    with:</p>

    <pre>
	name = input.askSimpleString("New class", "Name of the new class:", "Class");
	if (name != null) {
		uml.createClass(parentPackage, name);
	}
}
    </pre>

    <p>This code use the <code>input.askSimpleString()</code> service to open a
    dialog box and ask the user for a name (defaulting to "Class", the last
    parameter). If the user cancels the dialog box, the return value is
    <code>null</code>, and the script does nothing. Otherwise, it creates the
    new class using the <code>uml.createClass()</code> service, which specifies
    the package where to put the new class and its name.</p>

    <h3>Services Provided by the Standard DOMs in Topcased 2.1.0</h3>

    <p>In this section we document the services provided by the standard DOMs
    from Topcased 2.1.0.</p>

    <h4>The <code>org.topcased.scripting</code> DOM</h4>

    <p>Full identifier: <code>http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting</code></p>

    <p>This is the general Topcased scripting DOM which most Topcased scripts
    will use. It is independant of the specific language/meta-model used and
    provides services to interact with the user.</p>

    <p>When this DOM is used, the script has access to two new global JavaScript
    objects named <code>input</code> and <code>output</code>, which provides
    access to the following services:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>input.askSimpleString(title, message[, defaultValue])</code>
      opens a dialog box which allows the user to enter a string. If the user
      validates the dialog, the return value of the service is the string the
      user provided. If the user cancelled the dialog, the service returns
      <code>null</code>.</li>
      <li><code>input.ask(message)</code> is a simple shortcut to
      <code>input.askSimpleString()</code> when you do not need to sepcify a
      dialog title or default value.</li>
      <li><code>input.askQuestion(title, question)</code> opens a question
      dialog with the specified title and question, which should be a simple
      Yes/No question. The service returns <code>true</code> if the user answers
      Yes, and <code>false</code> if he answers No.</li>
      <li><code>input.askConfirmation(title, question)</code> opens a
      confirmation dialog with the specified title and question. The service
      returns <code>true</code> if the user confirmed, and <code>false</code>
      otherwise.</li>
      <li><code>input.selectContainer(title, message)</code> opens a dialog box
      which allows the user to select a container location (project or folder)
      in the workspace. The value returned by this service suitable to pass as a
      location to <code>output.createNewFile()</code> (see below).</li>
      <li><code>input.selectResource(title, message)</code> opens a dialog box
      which allows the user to select a file from the workspace. The value it
      returns is suitable to pass to <code>input.readFile()</code> (see below).
      A variant of this service takes no parameters and uses a default title and
      message.</li>
      <li><code>input.readFile(path)</code> reads a text file contained inside
      the workspace and returns its content as a string. The service returns
      <code>null</code> if an error occured (for example the file does not
      exists or is not a text file). The path argument can be either the return
      value of <code>input.selectResource()</code>, a file path relative to the
      workspace (e.g. <code>"/MyProject/mydirectory/myfile.txt"</code>), or an
      <code>IFile</code> object (used by many Eclipse APIs).</li>
      <li><code>output.createNewFile(directory, fileName, contents)</code> and
      <code>output.createNewFile(fullFilePath, contents)</code> create a new
      text file in the workspace with the specified contents. It returns
      <code>true</code> on success, and <code>false</code> if an error occured.
      In the first form (with 3 arguments), the directory argument can be either
      the return value of <code>input.selectContainer()</code>, an Eclipse
      <code>IPath</code> (returned by many Eclipse APIs) or a simple string of
      the form <code>"/MyProject/mydirectory"</code> (always relative to the
      workspace). In the second form with only two arguments, the first one can
      be either a string with the full file path (e.g.
      <code>"/MyProject/mydirectory/myfile.txt"</code>) or an <code>IFile</code>
      (returned by many Eclipse APIs). In both forms, the last arguments
      <code>contents</code> must be a string which corresponds to the contents
      to write to the file. The service returns <code>true</code> if it executed
      successfuly, and <code>false</code> if an error occured.</li>
      <li><code>output.console(message)</code> appends the specified message to
      the Topcased Scripting console.</li>
      <li><code>output.clearConsole()</code> clears the contents of the console.
      This can also be done manually by the user from the Console View's
      toolbar.</li>
      <li><code>output.info(title, message)</code> and
      <code>output.info(message)</code> open an information dialog box the
      specified (optional) title and message.</li>
      <li><code>output.warning(title, message)</code> and
      <code>output.warning(message)</code> open an warning dialog box the
      specified (optional) title and message.</li>
      <li><code>output.error(title, message)</code> and
      <code>output.error(message)</code> open an error dialog box the specified
      (optional) title and message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The <code>org.topcased.scripting.sam</code> DOM</h4>

    <p>Full identifier: <code>http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting.sam</code></p>

    <p>This DOM provides services to manipulate SAM models through a global
    object named <code>sam</code>.</p>

    <p>Services provided:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>sam.getSelection()</code> returns the selected element in the
      currently open SAM editor, or <code>null</code> if there is none. If
      multiple elements are selected, only the first one is returned.</li>
      <li><code>sam.getSelection(typeName)</code> is the same as
      <code>sam.getSelection()</code>, but returns <code>null</code> if the
      selected element is not of the specified type. For example, if a scripts
      requires that a System is selected it can simply call
      <code>sam.getSelection("System")</code>.</li>
      <li><code>sam.save()</code> saves the currently open SAM editor.</li>
      <li><code>sam.getFactory()</code> returns a <code>SAMFactory</code> object,
      which can be use to create any SAM elements by calling the appropriate
      <code>createXXX()</code> method. For example to create a State:
      <code>sam.getFactory().createState()</code></li>
      <li><code>sam.isA(element, typeName)</code> takes a model element and a
      type name, and returns <code>true</code> if the element is an instance of
      the named type, <code>false</code> otherwise. For example, to test if an
      element is an Automaton (or any sub-type): <code>sam.isA(elt,
      "Automaton")</code>.</li>
      <li><code>sam.createSystem(model, name)</code> and
      <code>sam.createSystem(system, name)</code> create a new SAM system, give
      it the specified name and add it into the specified model or parent
      system. The new system is returned.</li>
      <li><code>sam.createSystem(name)</code> creates a new system, sets its
      name and returns it.</li>
      <li><code>sam.createAutomaton(system, name)</code> and
      <code>sam.createAutomaton(name)</code> create a new automaton, set its
      name, add it into a parent system if specified, and return the new
      automaton.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The <code>org.topcased.scripting.sysml</code> DOM</h4>

    <p>Full identifier: <code>http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting.sysml</code></p>

    <p>This DOM provides services to manipulate SysML models through a global
    object named <code>sysml</code>. Note that because SysML is an extension of
    UML, the <code>sysml</code> object mostly provides SysML-specific services.
    Most SysML scripts will want to use the UML DOM in addition to the SysML one
    to manipulate SysML model elements which are actually UML objects.</p>

    <p>Services provided:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>sysml.getSelection()</code> returns the selected element in the
      currently open SysML editor, or <code>null</code> if there is none. If
      multiple elements are selected, only the first one is returned.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.getSelection(typeName)</code> is the same as
      <code>sysml.getSelection()</code>, but returns <code>null</code> if the
      selected element is not of the specified type. For example, if a scripts
      requires that a Block is selected it can simply call
      <code>sysml.getSelection("Block")</code>.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.save()</code> saves the currently open UML editor.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.getFactory()</code> return a <code>SysMLFactory</code>
      object, which can be use to create any SysML elements by calling the
      appropriate <code>createXXX()</code> method. For example to create a
      Requirement: <code>uml.getFactory().createRequirement()</code></li>
      <li><code>sysml.getUMLFactory()</code> return a <code>UMLFactory</code>
      object, which can be used to create any UML elements for use inside a SysML
      model, by calling the appropriate <code>createXXX()</code> method.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.createClass(name)</code> creates a new UML class, sets its
      name as specified and returns the new Class.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.createClass(parentPackage, name)</code> does the same as
      <code>sysml.createClass(name)</code> and additionaly places the new class
      into the specified Package.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.createPackage(name)</code> creates a new UML Package, sets
      its name and returns it.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.createBlock(name)</code> creates a new SysML Block, sets
      its name and returns it.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.createBlock(parentPackage, name)</code> creates a new
      SysML Block, sets its name, put it in the specified Package and returns
      it.</li>
      <li><code>sysml.isA(element, typeName)</code> takes a model element and a
      type name, and returns <code>true</code> if the element is an instance of
      the named type, <code>false</code> otherwise. For example, to test if an
      element is a Block (or any sub-type): <code>sysml.isA(elt,
      "Block")</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The <code>org.topcased.scripting.uml</code> DOM</h4>

    <p>Full identifier: <code>http://topcased-mm.gforge.enseeiht.fr/release/update-site3.4/org.topcased.scripting.uml</code></p>

    <p>This DOM provides services to manipulate UML models through a global
    object named <code>uml</code>.</p>

    <p>Services provided:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>uml.getSelection()</code> returns the selected element in the
      currently open UML editor, or <code>null</code> if there is none. If
      multiple elements are selected, only the first one is returned.</li>
      <li><code>uml.getSelection(typeName)</code> is the same as
      <code>uml.getSelection()</code>, but returns <code>null</code> if the
      selected element is not of the specified type. For example, if a scripts
      requires that a Package is selected it can simply call
      <code>uml.getSelection("Package")</code>.</li>
      <li><code>uml.save()</code> saves the currently open UML editor.</li>
      <li><code>uml.getFactory()</code> returns a <code>UMLFactory</code> object,
      which can be use to create any UML element by calling the appropriate
      <code>createXXX()</code> method. For example to create a Property:
      <code>uml.getFactory().createProperty()</code></li>
      <li><code>uml.createClass(name)</code> creates a new UML class, sets its
      name as specified and returns the new class.</li>
      <li><code>uml.createClass(parentPackage, name)</code> does the same as
      <code>uml.createClass(name)</code> and additionaly places the new class
      into the specified Package.</li>
      <li><code>uml.createPackage(name)</code> creates a new UML Package, sets
      its name and returns it.</li>
      <li><code>uml.isA(element, typeName)</code> takes a model element and a
      type name, and returns <code>true</code> if the element is an instance of
      the named type, <code>false</code> otherwise. For example, to test if an
      element is a Package (or any sub-type): <code>uml.isA(elt,
      "Package")</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Accessing APIs Outside the DOMS</h4>

    <p>The DOMs described above give access to a limited set of objects, which
    should be seen as entry points into the full APIs available to the scripts.
    The objects returned by the DOM methods (for example
    <code>getSelection()</code> or <code>getFactory()</code>) are actually Java
    objects, and your scripts have access to all the (public) methods these
    objects provide.</p>

    <p>For example, if you do <code>var a = uml.createClass("A")</code>, the
    value returned of <code>a</code> is a Java object from the UML meta-model,
    which provides many methods to query and modify the UML class it represents:
    <code>a.getName()</code>, <code>a.getSuperClasses()</code>,
    <code>a.getOwnedOperations()</code>, <code>a.setIsAbstract()</code>,
    etc.</p>

    <p>This short manual can not reproduce the many methods available on all the
    elements of the SAM, SysML and UML meta-models, or in the underlying Eclipse
    and Topcased platforms. Refer to the corresponding API references in the
    Topcased Developer Guide for a complete list of methods you can use on these
    objects.</p>

    <h2 id="extending">Extending The Scripts's Capabilities</h2>

    <p>The scripting capabilities can be extended by creating new DOMs, which
    give access to other parts of the Eclipse and Topcased platforms and offer
    new services.</p>

    <p>To create a new DOM, you need to write an Eclipse plugin which extends
    the <code>org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey.dom</code> extension point and specifies
    one or several implementation(s) of the <code>IMonkeyDOMFactory</code> Java
    interface. Each such implementation will provide a new global object to the
    scripts using the DOM, and the public Java methods defined on the DOM object
    will be available to the scripts.</p>

    <p>Refer to the documentation and source code of the Eclipse Monkey
    framework and the already provided Topcased DOMs for more technical details
    and example code.</p>
